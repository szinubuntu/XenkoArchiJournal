Tutorials are useful when workflow is **specific** and **indexed**.

# List

1. \[Version Control, Project Management\] Add to (git) version control

Remark: When creating a project in **Xenko studio**, a `.gitignore` file is automatically generated. So we just need to create the repository at solution folder and it's ready to go.

1. \[Effect, Particle System, Rendering, Skeletal Mesh\] Create a Trail, How to Bind Entity to Bone

Summary:

```
```

2. \[Object Manipulation, Scene Management\] Place an object on the ground

Surprisingly Xenko doesn't have an edit button or keyboard shortcut like UE4 to place object on the ground, so how do we handle this precisely?

The lease we can do is to turn off **selection mask** (Top bar at 3D view the right-most button) so things are easier to see.

2. \[Camera, Effect, Rendering\] Render Texture, How to Render a Mirror

Summary:

```
```
