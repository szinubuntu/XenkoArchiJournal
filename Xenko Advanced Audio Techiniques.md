# On Sounds

A wise man once said, **sound is all you needed for a successful game**. We are not talking about music, which is easily appreviated by players, we are talking about short burst of sound effects that are played when certain actions or events happen. Good quality sounds are rare resources, and though it's usually perceptively subtle and functions so naturally in the background we tend to not realize they are there - but the difference between a game with good sounds vs a game with poorly designed or poorly sampled sounds. 

Sounds can provide pleasing gaming experience, provide clues to game processing, and add interest to the otherwise boring and repetitive game contents. 

That's enough for the backgrond, the **craft of sound** is like the **craft of graphical assets**, it's art. From a developer's point of view, we are concerned with how we can present the sounds - assuming good qualities sounds are already provided to us by other hard-working people.
